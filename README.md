# 🌱 Plant Doctor Frontend – Web Interface for AI Plant Disease Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

Plant Doctor Frontend is a web application that provides a user-friendly interface for the Plant Doctor AI system. The application allows users to upload plant leaf images and receive disease predictions along with treatment recommendations generated by the backend machine learning model.

The interface is designed to make AI-powered plant disease detection accessible to farmers, students, and gardeners without requiring technical knowledge.

## 🔗 System Integration

This frontend connects to the **Plant Doctor Backend API** which:

1. Receives the image
2. Runs the CNN model
3. Predicts plant disease
4. Returns treatment suggestions

## 🔗 Backend & Machine Learning Model

This frontend works together with the AI backend system which performs the plant disease detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

👉 Backend Repository (Machine Learning Model):
[https://github.com/vipulofficial206/plant-doctor](https://github.com/vipulofficial206/plant-doctor)

The backend:

* Receives uploaded images
* Processes them using the trained deep learning model
* Predicts plant diseases
* Returns treatment and prevention suggestions to the frontend

## 📊 How It Works

1. User uploads a plant leaf image
2. Frontend sends the image to backend API
3. Backend CNN model processes the image
4. Disease prediction is returned
5. UI displays diagnosis and treatment advice
